## Integration with Ecosystem

- 🤖 **CausalIQ Pipeline** (causaliq-pipeline) makes use of this package (zenodo-sync) to download datasets and intermediate results required for experimental pipelines, and to upload new results and analysis to Zenodo.
- 🧪 **CausalIQ Experiments** (causaliq-experiments) are defined in terms of CausalIQ Pipelines allowing the reproduction of experiments, results and
published paper assets created by the CausalIQ ecosystem.

## Standalone Use

- 🌐 Zenodo Synchronisation is general-purpose software which can synchronise _any_ local resources with Zenodo deposits.
