# 🧠 CausalIQ Knowledge Project

The CausalIQ Knowledge project represents a novel approach to causal discovery by combining the traditional statistical structure learning algorithms with the contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. This integration enables more interpretable, domain-aware, and human-friendly causal discovery workflows.

## Possible Key Innovations

### 🧠 Domain Knowledge Integration
- **Natural language constraints**: Specify domain knowledge in plain English
- **Expert knowledge incorporation**: Convert expert understanding into algorithmic constraints
- **Contextual graph interpretation**: Understanding variable meanings and relationships

### 🔄 Interactive Discovery
- **Conversational interfaces**: Query causal relationships in natural language
- **Hypothesis testing**: Test specific causal hypotheses through dialogue
- **Iterative refinement**: Collaboratively improve causal models through interaction

### 📝 Automated Explanation
- **Relationship explanations**: Natural language descriptions of discovered causal links
- **Uncertainty communication**: Clear explanation of confidence levels and limitations
- **Report generation**: Automated research summaries and methodology descriptions

## Upcoming Integration with Ecosystem

- 🔍 **CausalIQ Discovery** makes use of this package to learn more 
accurate graphs.
- 🧪 **CausalIQ Analysis** uses this package to explain the learning process, intelligently combine end explain results.
- 🔮 **CausalIq Predict** uses this package to explain predictions made by learnt models.
