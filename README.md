# 👋 Welcome to CausalIQ

I’m an **independent researcher** and **research visitor** at Queen Mary University of London working on **causal discovery** and **Bayesian network structure learning**.
These repositories bring together algorithms, experiments, and datasets that support research into more accurate and stable methods for causal discovery.

## 🔍 Research focus

* Bayesian networks (discrete and continuous)
* Score-based causal discovery algorithms.
* Variable ordering and stability in learned graphs
* Integration of human and domain knowledge into causal discovery
* Open-source, reproducible pipelines for experiments and evaluation

## 📂 Key repositories

* [**discovery**](https://github.com/causaliq/discovery) → core algorithms for structure learning
* [**zenodo-sync**](https://github.com/causaliq/zenodo-sync) → synchronising research outputs onto Zenodo


## 🌍 Project identity

The **CausalIQ** name reflects both:

* *Causal Inference and Discovery*, and
* the role of *human intelligence* in guiding algorithmic learning.

All code and datasets will be released to support open, reproducible research.
