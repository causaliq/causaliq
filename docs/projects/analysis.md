# 🔢 CausalIQ Analysis Project

The CausalIQ Analysis project provides Tools for analysing and visualising learned causal graphs, including structural metrics, stability assessment, significance tests, and publication-ready tables and charts.

- **Foundation metrics**: CausalIQ and Bayesys structural graph metrics and KL metric.
- **Legacy trace**: Support for reading and writing structure learning traces in legacy pickle format (this will be superseded by a more open format).
- **Graph Averaging**: Graph averaging to produce arc probabilities.

## Upcoming Key Innovations

### 🧠 LLM-assisted Graph Averaging
- **Uncertain or conflicting edges** - resolved using LLM queries

### 📊 Publication-ready chart generation
- **Seaborn charts** - flexible, but standardised publication-ready chart generation

### ▦ Publication-ready table generation
- **LaTeX tables** - converts tabular analysis data into publication-ready LaTeX tables

## Integration with CausalIQ Ecosystem

- 🔍 **CausalIQ Discovery** generates causal graphs which this package evaluates and visualises.
- 🤖 **CausalIQ Workflow** can access all features of this package (through the Action interface) so that analysis and visualisation are incorporated into CausalIQ workflows.
- 🧪 **CausalIQ Research** uses the analysis, table and chart features of this package to generate published paper assets.
