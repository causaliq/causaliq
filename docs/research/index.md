# Research Overview

This section provides accessible explanations of the key concepts, methods, and innovations in causal discovery research that form the foundation of the CausalIQ ecosystem.

## Core Research Areas

### [Causal Discovery](causal-discovery.md)
Understanding how to uncover causal relationships from observational data, including the fundamental challenges and modern algorithmic approaches.

### [Bayesian Networks](bayesian-networks.md)  
Graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships between variables, providing a framework for reasoning under uncertainty.

### [LLM Integration](llm-integration.md)
Novel approaches for combining Large Language Models with traditional statistical methods to enhance causal reasoning and interpretation.

## Research Philosophy

The research presented here is guided by several key principles:

**Statistical Rigour**: All methods are grounded in solid mathematical foundations, with careful attention to assumptions and limitations.

**Practical Applicability**: While theoretically sound, the focus is on developing methods that solve real-world problems across multiple domains.

**Interpretability**: Emphasis on methods that provide clear, understandable insights into causal mechanisms rather than black-box predictions.

**Reproducibility**: All research follows open science principles with publicly available code, data, and comprehensive documentation.

**Interdisciplinary Impact**: Developing tools and methods that benefit researchers across domains, from medicine to economics to social sciences.

## Methodological Innovations

### Hybrid Statistical-AI Approaches
Combining the precision of statistical algorithms with the contextual understanding of artificial intelligence to create more robust and interpretable causal discovery methods.

### Stability and Uncertainty Analysis
Developing comprehensive frameworks for assessing the reliability and uncertainty of discovered causal relationships through bootstrap analysis and sensitivity testing.

### Scalable Algorithms
Creating efficient implementations that can handle large variable sets and datasets while maintaining statistical validity.

### Domain Integration
Methods for incorporating domain knowledge and expert understanding into algorithmic causal discovery processes.

## Applications

The research has applications across numerous domains:

- **Medical Research**: Understanding disease mechanisms and treatment effects
- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluating the causal impact of interventions and policies  
- **Business Intelligence**: Identifying the drivers of key performance metrics
- **Scientific Discovery**: Uncovering causal mechanisms in natural and social phenomena
- **Machine Learning**: Building more robust and interpretable AI systems

## Future Directions

Future research directions might include:

- **Real-time Causal Discovery**: Methods for learning causal relationships from streaming data
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving causal discovery across distributed datasets
- **Multi-modal Integration**: Incorporating text, images, and other data types into causal analysis
- **Automated Scientific Discovery**: AI systems that can autonomously generate and test causal hypotheses
