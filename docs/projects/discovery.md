- [🚀 Quick Start](https://github.com/causaliq/causaliq-discovery/blob/main/README.md)

## ✅ Current Features

- score-based **HC** and **Tabu** algorithms
- Support for **discrete and continuous** data types
- **Stability enhancements** so that results not dependent on arbitrary artifacts of the data (e.g. variable order)
- **Active learning** whereby algorithm can dynamically request knowledge in areas of uncertainty.

## Integration with Ecosystem

- 🎯 **CausalIQ Score** (causaliq-score) is used by this package to determine the score of graphs.
- 🤖 **CausalIQ Workflow** uses this package in structure learning workflows.

## Standalone Use

Users may use this package standalone in one-off structure learning experiments or as part of their own workflows.
